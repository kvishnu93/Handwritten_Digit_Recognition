# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition

Dimensionality reduction of MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data using PCA and t-SNE and Predicting the Handwritten Digits using Neural Networks in AZURE ML.

In Part 1 of the code, I had done dimensionality reduction of MNIST data set using PCA and t-SNE.

In Part 2_Phase 2 code, I had used Aritifical Neural Networks to build my model to recognize hand written digits given in 28*28 pixel.

I had saved my model in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) and named as digit_predict.h5

Further, I had used loaded my model with saved model in new_model and predicted the hand written digits.
